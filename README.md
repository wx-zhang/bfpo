## ðŸ“° News
- **(2025-01)**: Our paper is accepted to ICLR 2025 as spotlight presentation! ðŸŽ‰
- **(2024-08)**: We release the paper on ArXiv. Check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15313).

## ðŸ“š Introduction
This project aims to improve the safety during the alignment of the LLMs and mitigate the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness with low cost. We propose a novel Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO) framework, which convert a joint RLHF reward of safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. 

This repo contains the implementation for the BFPO framework, as well as the code for the experiments in the paper.



## ðŸš€ Getting started
To run the code in this project, first, create a Python virtual environment using e.g. Conda:

```shell
conda create -n bfpo python=3.10 && conda activate bfpo
```
Next, install PyTorch `v2.1.2`. We direct you to the [PyTorch Installation Page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

You can then install the remaining package dependencies as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wx-zhang/bfpo.git
cd ./bfpo
python -m pip install .
```
