## 📰 News
- **(2025-01)**: Our paper is accepted to ICLR 2025 as spotlight presentation! 🎉
- **(2024-08)**: We release the paper on ArXiv. Check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15313).

## 📚 Introduction
This project aims to improve the safety during the alignment of the LLMs and mitigate the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness with low cost. We propose a novel Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO) framework, which convert a joint RLHF reward of safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. 

This repo contains the implementation for the BFPO framework, as well as the code for the experiments in the paper.



## 🚀 Getting started
To run the code in this project, first, create a Python virtual environment using e.g. Conda:

```shell
conda create -n bfpo python=3.10 && conda activate bfpo
```
Next, install PyTorch `v2.1.2`. We direct you to the [PyTorch Installation Page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

You can then install the remaining package dependencies as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wx-zhang/bfpo.git
cd ./bfpo
python -m pip install .
```


## 📊 Reproduce Results

To reproduce the alignment results, use the following command:

```shell
bash bfpo.sh
```

To reproduce the red teaming results, use the following command:

```shell
bash redteaming.sh
```


## 🙏 Acknowledgments
These open source projects played a pivotal role in our research:
- Our codebase is built upon  [alignment-handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook). 
- The buffered trainer is based on [trl](https://github.com/huggingface/trl)
- The evaluation code is adapted from [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness).
